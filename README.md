# KotlinSweet
MVP, Dagger2, KTX and more


Sample MVP Project Kotlin project. It contains latest implementation of Kotlin and the libs around it. Its a good base to start a project.

We'll look at Dagger, Butterknife, Data Binding, Auto-parcel and DBFlow (other frameworks can be set up similarly). All these frameworks work through annotation processing: you annotate the code to have the boiler-plate code generated for you. Annotations allow to hide all the verbosity and keep your code simple, and if you need to understand what actually happens at runtime, you can look at the generated code. Note that all these frameworks generate source code in Java, not Kotlin.

In Kotlin you specify the dependencies in a similar to Java way using Kotlin Annotation processing tool (kapt) instead of annotationProcessor.

All the tools for this project are updated to the latest and tested.
